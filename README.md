Nawiat is a cool CMS that Laravel users can extend with no learning curve.

Design philosophy:
* Utilize on Laravel rather than adding more magics.
* NoSQL is more flexibile.
* Content of some kinds of modules are better stored in files rather than database.
* Each module/admin panel is just a Laravel package.
* Modules favor for flexbility; Admin panels favor for conventions.
