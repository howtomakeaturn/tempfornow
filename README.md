Nawiat is a cool CMS that Laravel users can extend with no learning curve.

Design philosophy:
* Utilize on Laravel rather than adding more magics.
* Content of some kinds of modules are better stored in files rather than database.
* Each module/admin panel is just a Laravel package.
* Modules favor for flexbility; Admin panels favor for conventions.
* Components are all provided by the Modules. CMS itself provides as less stuff as possible.

Considering:
* NoSQL is more flexibile.

Slogan: Nawiat. A super extendible CMS made for developers based on Laravel.
