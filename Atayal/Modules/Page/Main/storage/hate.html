<p>Here&#39;s the things that&nbsp;Atayal really hates.</p>

<p>You may think Atayal sucks because of these.</p>

<h1>Theme system</h1>

<p>Theme system results in huge tradeoffs&nbsp;to a CMS.</p>

<p>It forces all developers of the CMS to obey a lot of conventions and make it really difficult to extend for developers not familiar with the CMS.</p>

<p>Atayal drops it totally. So your clients cannot switch the themes in the admin panel at all.</p>

<p>Create a customized theme for your clients and then ship the product to them.</p>

<p>If they want to change it afterwards, ask them&nbsp;to hire designers.</p>
