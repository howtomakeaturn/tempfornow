<h1>Why is Atayal different from other CMS?</h1>

<p>Because Atayal is very&nbsp;cynical and it really hates&nbsp;all the&nbsp;social norms.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the things that&nbsp;Atayal really hates about.</p>

<p><em>You might&nbsp;think Atayal sucks because of this.</em></p>

<h1>Theme system</h1>

<p>Theme system results in huge tradeoffs&nbsp;to a CMS.</p>

<p>It forces all developers of the CMS to obey a lot of conventions and make it really difficult to extend for developers not familiar with the CMS.</p>

<p>Atayal drops it totally.</p>

<p>So your clients cannot switch the themes in the admin panel at all.</p>

<p>Create a customized theme for your clients and then ship the product to them.</p>

<p>If your clients&nbsp;want to change the theme&nbsp;afterwards, ask them&nbsp;to hire designers/developers to edit source code of the layout&nbsp;directly.</p>

<h1>Admin Panel</h1>

<p>A consistent layout for admin panels results in huge tradeoffs&nbsp;to a CMS.</p>

<p>To extend a CMS you usually need to extend the admin panel system, too.</p>

<p>If the CMS wants to make the admin panels have&nbsp;consistent layouts, the developers need to&nbsp;memorize&nbsp;a lot of stuff from the CMS.</p>

<p>Atayal drops it totally.</p>

<p>You decide how&nbsp;your admin panels should look like.</p>

<p>Atayal doesn&#39;t provide any single components for you to use for your admin panels.</p>
